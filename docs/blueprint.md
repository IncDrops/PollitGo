## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light and airy blue (#A0D2EB) to evoke a sense of calm and clarity.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) providing a clean, uncluttered backdrop.

- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean and fashionable look. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different categories or poll types.
- Implement dynamic swipe animations: When one card slides out of the side and away, the card from the poll above it should slide down into its place.

- Navigation bar with home, search, new poll, messages, and notifications on the bottom. Settings and profile in the upper right corner.
- Mobile-first look and feel, with no giant bezels or negative space. Smooth infinite scroll.
