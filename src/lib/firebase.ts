// Firebase services have been removed from this project.
// This file is a placeholder.
// You will need to implement an alternative backend for authentication, database, etc.

// Example: If you were to use a different BaaS or your own backend,
// initializations would go here.

console.warn(
  "Firebase has been removed. Authentication, Firestore, and Storage are not available. " +
  "You need to integrate an alternative backend solution."
);

// To prevent errors in files that might still try to import 'auth', 'db', etc.,
// we can export null or dummy objects. However, it's cleaner to remove
// those imports from the files that use them. For now, this helps avoid
// immediate crashes during transition.

export const app = null;
export const auth = null;
export const db = null;
export const storage = null;
export const fetchUserProfile = async (userId: string) => {
  console.warn("fetchUserProfile: Firebase is removed. Cannot fetch profile for user:", userId);
  return null;
};

// It's highly recommended to remove all usages of these exports
// throughout your application and replace them with your new backend solution.
